# Mitigate threats by using Defender XDR (25â€“30%)
Microsoft Defender XDR (formerly Microsoft 365 Defender) is a security operations platform that unifies security with XDR and SIEM across the cyberattack chain. It provides incident-level visibility, automatic disruption, rapid response, and multitenant management for endpoints, identities, cloud apps, email, and more. Microsoft Defender XDR is a cross-product solution that detects, prevents, investigates, and responds to sophisticated attacks across endpoints, identities, email, and applications.

The following are the Microsoft Defender XDR components:
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**: Provides endpoint protection and security management for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices.
- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**: Offers protection against phishing, malware, and other email threats.
- **Microsoft Defender for Identity**: Detects and investigates identity-based threats, leveraging signals from both on-premises Active Directory and cloud identities.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**: Provides visibility into cloud app usage and detects and blocks risky activities.
- **Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management**: Identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities in your network.
- **Microsoft Entra ID Protection**: Helps secure user identities and credentials.
- **Microsoft Data Loss Prevention**: Monitor and protect sensitive information across on-premises systems, cloud-based locations, and endpoint devices.
- **App Governance**: Security and policy management capability that monitors and governs app behaviours and quickly identifies, alerts, and protects from risky behaviours with data, users, and apps.
