# Mitigate threats by using Defender XDR (25â€“30%)
Microsoft Defender XDR (formerly Microsoft 365 Defender) is a security operations platform that unifies security with XDR and SIEM across the cyberattack chain. It provides incident-level visibility, automatic disruption, rapid response, and multitenant management for endpoints, identities, cloud apps, email, and more. Microsoft Defender XDR is a cross-product solution that detects, prevents, investigates, and responds to sophisticated attacks across endpoints, identities, email, and applications.

The following are the Microsoft Defender XDR components:
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**: Provides endpoint protection and security management for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices.
- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**: Offers protection against phishing, malware, and other email threats.
- **Microsoft Defender for Identity**: Detects and investigates identity-based threats, leveraging signals from both on-premises Active Directory and cloud identities.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**: Provides visibility into cloud app usage and detects and blocks risky activities.
- **Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management**: Identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities in your network.
- **Microsoft Entra ID Protection**: Helps secure user identities and credentials.
- **Microsoft Data Loss Prevention**: Monitor and protect sensitive information across on-premises systems, cloud-based locations, and endpoint devices.
- **App Governance**: Security and policy management capability that monitors and governs app behaviours and quickly identifies, alerts, and protects from risky behaviours with data, users, and apps.

## Mitigate threats to the Microsoft 365 environment by using Microsoft Defender XDR
**Investigate, respond, and remediate threats to Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive**

- Files: Gives visibility into all the files from connected cloud apps, for example, OneDrive and SharePoint. Take actions on files like moving files to user quarantine, moving to trash or applying a sensitivity label.
- Review: Teams messages and OneDrive/SharePoint files can be removed from users accounts and placed into quarantine. False-positive quarantine items can be released back to users.
- Activity Log: Gives visibility into all activities from connected apps, for example, logins, password resets and file deletes.
- Advanced Hunting: The _CloudAppEvents_ table in the advanced hunting schema contains information about events involving accounts and objects in Office 365 and other cloud apps and services. 

**Investigate, respond, and remediate threats to email by using Microsoft Defender for Office 365**

![Threat Explorer](https://github.com/alfonso-greenbrook/SC-200-Microsoft-Security-Operations-Analyst/blob/ef6ff4e35ce94d2629a03688ee43470f26a4bc47/Part1-Defender-XDR/Threat_Explorer.png?raw=true)
- Threat Explorer: Search for emails using various filters, including sender, recipient, URLs and attachments.
  - Can view malware, phishing, campaigns, and URL clicks.
  - Can take actions like soft/hard deleting emails, moving emails to junk/deleted folders, and triggering investigations. 
- Investigations: _Automated investigation and response (AIR)_ capabilities can automatically undertake remediation actions; some actions require admin approval, such as soft deleting related mail messages or clusters.
- Action Center: Shows a list of pending and completed remediation actions taken on devices, email & collaboration content, and identities; for example, quarantining files, isolating devices and soft deleting emails. 
- Review: Quarantined email content can be reviewed, emails downloaded for further analysis and false positive emails released back to users. 
- Policies and Rules: Threat Policies and Alert Policies:
  - Threat Policies:
    - Standard Protection: baseline protection against spam, phishing and malware threats.
    - Strict Protection: more aggressive protection profile for selected users or groups.
    - Anti-phishing, anti-spam, anti-malware
    - Safe Attachments: monitor, block, dynamic delivery
    - Safe Links: email messages, Teams, Office Apps
    - Tenant Allow/Block lists
  - Alert Policy: edit existing policies or create new alert policies
- Advanced Hunting: The _EmailAttachmentInfo, EmailEvents, EmailPostDeliveryEvents_ and _EmailUrlInfo_ tables in the advanced hunting scheme contain information about inbound, outbound and internal email traffic. 

**Investigate and respond to alerts generated by data loss prevention (DLP) policies**

- Classifiers: tools that can be trained to recognize various types of content by giving them samples to look at; they can be used to identify items for application of Office sensitivity labels, Communications compliance policies, and retention label policies.
  - Trainable Classifiers
  - Sensitivity Info Type
  - Fingerprint-based sensitive information type (SIT)
  - Exact Data Match (EDM)
- Activity Explorer: review activity related to content that contains sensitive information or has labels applied, such as what labels were changed, files were modified and more.
  - Label activity is monitored across Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive and endpoint devices. 
- Content Explorer: explore emails and documents in the tenant that have labels applied or contain sensitive information. 
- Information Protection: sensitivity labels can be created to classify emails and documents; content with particular labels can be protected if configured in settings.
  - Auto Labelling is used to automatically apply sensitivity labels to emails or SharePoint and OneDrive files that contain sensitive information. 

**Investigate and respond to alerts generated by insider risk policies**
