# Mitigate threats by using Defender for Cloud (15â€“20%)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a comprehensive _cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP)_ that safeguards cloud-based applications across multicloud and hybrid environments. The platform is made up of the following key components:
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: This aspect focuses on proper configuration and deployment of your cloud and on-premises resources. It identifies steps to secure your environment, ensuring that your cloud setup adheres to best practices1.
- **Cloud Workload Protection (CWP)**: Defender for Cloud provides specific protections for servers, containers, storage, databases, and other workloads. It helps shield your applications from various cyber threats and vulnerabilities1.
- **DevOps Security**: By unifying security management at the code level across multiple pipelines (including GitHub, Azure DevOps, and GitLab), Defender for Cloud empowers security teams to protect applications from code to cloud. It correlates DevOps security findings with contextual cloud security insights, allowing prioritized remediation in code1.

## Implement and maintain cloud security posture management

**Assign and manage regulatory compliance policies, including Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)**

- Assign security standards to specific scopes such as Azure subscriptions, AWS accounts, and GCP projects that have Defender for Cloud enabled.
- Defender for Cloud continually assesses the environment in scope against standards. Based on assessments, it shows in-scope resources as being compliant or noncompliant with the standard and provides remediation recommendations.
